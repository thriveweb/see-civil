  Quarry Solutions operates Petersons Quarry under a lease and profit-a-prende
  arrangement with the asset owner, Richmond Valley Council. 


  Quarry Solutions also identified and developed an adjacent site known as the
  Coraki Quarry. Although separate holdings, the Petersons and Coraki Quarries
  operate under a single Environmental Protection Licence. These sites provided
  a majority of the materials supplied by QS for the Pacific Highway Upgrade -
  Woolgoolga to Ballina. 


  Quarry Solutions undertook plant and equipment upgrades for the operation of
  Petersons and Coraki during the delivery of the Pacific Highway Upgrade
  project. The quarry sites are operated with a high-volume, high-quality
  approach. In 2018, Petersons and Coraki produced around 1.2 million tonnes of
  aggregate stock, selling aroudn 1 million tonnes of this. 


  The resource is generally described as comprising a basalt flow of varying
  thickness, typically from 12-20 metres.
