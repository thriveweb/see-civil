  The Tikitere Quarry is a fixed quarry located in North Star in western New
  South Wales. Quarry Solutions commenced sourcing materials in the western New
  South Wales region in 2017 ahead of the upcoming Inland Rail project. Tikitere
  was the first of several sites to be approved for quarrying. 


  Tikitere will supply ballast, capping and other construction materials to
  various contractors and projects on the Inland Rail alignment. The quarry is
  also supplying products for road construction, including foamed bitumen, to
  the Newell HIghway Mungleback Creek to Boggabilla project. 


  Tikitere is a high-quality basalt resource which forms a prominent hill and
  ridge line. The basalt flow averages 5-6 metres thick and extends for
  approximately 1.6 kilometres.
