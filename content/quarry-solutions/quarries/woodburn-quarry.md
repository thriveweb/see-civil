  Quarry Solutions sourced this fixed quarry site to help service the major
  supply contract for the Pacific Highway Upgrade - Woolgoolga to Ballina and to
  supply the underlying local market. Woodburn Quarry is owned by Richmond
  Valley Council and operated by Quarry Solutions. 


  Major production at Woodburn was split into two stages. Stage One processed
  around 1.4 million tonnes of R44 specified fill and rock products and Stage
  Two processed around 1 million tonnes of 3071 SMZ, verge and drainage rock. 


  Quarry Solutions undertook significant investment in plant and equipment for
  the quarry with plant configurations including a customised trommel, Metsco
  C160 jaw crusher, HP500 cone crusher and 20 x 8 HD screen. 


  Woodburn is a predominantly sandstone resource.
