  Our Woodburn pre-cast yard has capability and capacity to produce a range of
  products for the civil construction and rural and agricultural industries.
  We've supplied headwalls and culverts to major infrastructure and urban
  development projects in New South Wales. 


  Our quality and project management teams are experienced in producing pre-cast
  elements to specification and work closely with our engineering team to
  develop pre-cast design requirements. Our part in SEE Group means we can
  utilise the broader experience of the group and develop and design pre-cast
  solutions for any project.
