    With our focus on delivering quality concrete solutions and products safely
    and superior customer service, we've been exceeding our clientâ€™s
    expectations everywhere we operate. 


    ICS was established on the north coast of New South Wales in 2018 to fill an
    identified gap in the local ready mix concrete market and ensure high
    quality concrete products were available locally. Since then, we've grown
    our team and capabilities to include pre-cast concrete design and
    manufacturing as well as expanding our footprint through several strategic
    acquisitions. 


    The ICS team is made up of concrete professionals with decades of experience
    in the ready mix and pre-cast concrete industry. Together we own operate
    three fixed concrete batching sites with additional capacity, capability and
    equipment for mobile batching and delivery operations. 


    Our team of experts are passionate about making sure every client
    experiences our difference in quality concrete products and superior
    customer service when creating a complete concrete solution for their
    projects.
