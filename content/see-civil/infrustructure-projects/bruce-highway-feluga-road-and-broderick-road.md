      * Clearing and grubbing of project areas. 

      * Removal of approximately 1,500 cubic metres of unsuitable material

      * Import and placement of around 30,000 cubic metres of CBR 7 and CBR10
      general fill material to the project via truck and dogs. This equated to
      more than 1000 truck movements made without incident. 

      * Construction of drainage infrastructure including 6 individual culvert
      structures, using 680 individual pre-cast culvert units. The largest
      culvert was a 12 span, 32 metre wide structure. 

      * The entire project was undertaken adjacent to an environmentally
      sensitive waterway which drains into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.
      Works were delivered without environmental incidents.

      * Construction of new road pavements including a 250mm Foam Bitumen
      stabilised base layer.
