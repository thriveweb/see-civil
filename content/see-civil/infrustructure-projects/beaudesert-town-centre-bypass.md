  The Beaudesert Town Centre Bypass involved the construction of a new 1.5
  kilometre section of the Mount Lindesay Highway connecting to Helen Street (in
  the north) and Beaudesert-Boonah Road/Bromelton Street (in the south),
  bypassing the main street of Beaudesert. 


  The town centre bypass is two-lane 80 kilometre per hour road with signalised
  intersections at each tie-in. The road was constructed with Q50 flood
  immunity, including a three-span (51 metres) bridge over Spring Creek and
  major multi-cell drainage structures.

    content: >-
      * All bulk and detailed earthworks for the project including 20,000 cubic
      metres of on site excavation, 100,000 tonne of import embankment material
      placed on black soil, 20,000 square metres of subgrade treatment and 3,500
      cubic metres of special embankment (rock fill into lagoon). 

      * Construction of plant-mixed stabilised pavements, dense grade asphalt
      and stone matic asphalt.

      * Construction of a three-span bridge over Spring Creek 

      * Significant changes to bridge construction methodology due to on site
      ground conditions which prevented a full redesign of the bridge. 

      * Construction of two new signalised intersections and installation of
      Intelligent Transport System infrastracture. 

      * Complex environmental management, especially associated with
      construction works over the environmentally sensitive Spring Creek. 

      * Recovery of the construction program following a significant flood event
      caused by ex-Tropical Cyclone Debbie in which 247mm of rain fell in one
      day, to deliver the project on budget and one month ahead of schedule. 

      * Implementation of complex traffic staging and management on the Mount
      Lindesay Highway. 

      * Project area classified as a Category 5 - High Risk for Cultural
      Heritage finds, resulting in dedicated management procedures incorporated
      into the works and environmental managmeent planning.
