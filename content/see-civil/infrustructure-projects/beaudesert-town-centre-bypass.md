  The Beaudesert Town Centre Bypass involved the construction of a new 1.5
  kilometre section of the Mount Lindesay Highway connecting to Helen Street (in
  the north) and Beaudesert-Boonah Road/Bromelton Street (in the south),
  bypassing the main street of Beaudesert. 


  The town centre bypass is two-lane 80 kilometre per hour road with signalised
  intersections at each tie-in. The road was constructed with Q50 flood
  immunity, including a three-span (51 metres) bridge over Spring Creek and
  major multi-cell drainage structures.
