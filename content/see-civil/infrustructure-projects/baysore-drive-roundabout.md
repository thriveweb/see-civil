  The Bayshore Drive Roundabout project involved the construction of a new
  gateway roundabout at the intersection of Bayshore Drive and Ewingsdale Road -
  the main entrance to Byron Bay. 


  SEE Civil was appointed by the Byron Shire Council to construct the roundabout
  under live traffic. Funding for the project was provided to the council
  through the Building Better Regions Fund - a federal government grants
  program. 


  The roundabout was designed to improve the traffic flow through one of Byron
  Bay's busiest intersections and provide improved access to the growing Arts &
  Industrial Estate. 


  The project involved complex traffic management and staging and major asset
  relocations including water mains and overhead powerlines.
