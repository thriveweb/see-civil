  The Alstonville Bypass project involved the construction of a six and half
  kilometre new road including earthworks, drainage, structures and pavement
  works. 


  A key interchange was constructed at Kays Lane and the new road was tied-in to
  the Bruxner Highway at each end. This required careful traffic planning and
  the implementation of traffic control on the highway as well as surrounding
  local roads.
