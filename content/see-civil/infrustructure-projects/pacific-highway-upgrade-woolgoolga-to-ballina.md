  On behalf of the Australian and NSW governments, Roads and Maritime Services
  is progressively upgrading the Pacific Highway to dual carriageway between the
  Hunter and NSW/Queensland border. The Woolgoolga to Ballina Pacific Highway
  upgrade involves the duplication of 155 kilometres to a four-lane divided
  road. The upgrade starts about six kilometres north of Woolgoolga (north of
  Coffs Harbour) and ends about six kilometres south of Ballina.


  SEE Civil were awarded their first package of work for the Woolgoolga to
  Ballina project in 2015. From 2015 to 2019 we delivered seven packages for the
  overall project including soft soil and foundation treamtent works, roadworks
  packages including the construction of a new service road between Woodburn and
  Broadwater, various enabling works packages including the management of a
  large borrow pit and an innovative foamed bitumen package.  


  Over the course of our work on the Woolgoola to Ballina project, SEE Civil has
  been praised at various times for their enviornmental management and
  committment to working safely under the client's 'Next Gear' safety program.
  In 2017, our Wave 5C early works project won a Civil Contractors Federation
  Earth Award. In addition to SEE Civil's work, Quarry Solutions was the Primary
  Supplier for quarried materials on the Woolgoolga to Ballina project.
