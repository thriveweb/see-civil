The Woolgoolga to Ballina Pacific Highway upgrade involves the duplication of 155 kilometres to a four-lane divided road. The upgrade starts about six kilometres north of Woolgoolga (north of Coffs Harbour) and ends about six kilometres south of Ballina. \r\n\nThe Wave 4 Early Works package is part of the Woolgoolga to Ballina Pacific Highway upgrade. SEECivil worked collaboratively with Roads and Maritime Services and Pacific Complete to deliver this part of the Woolgoolga to Ballina Pacific Highway upgrade. \n\nThere early works were undertaken to ensure appropriate management, pre-load and settlement of soft soil areas prior to major roadworks commencing on this section of highway."
