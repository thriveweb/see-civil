  The Kingscliff Foreshore Revitalisation project was a three-stage project
  aimed at the long-term protection of the foreshore from erosion and the
  revitalisation of the foreshore precinct connecting the Kingscliff CBD to the
  Pacific Ocean. 


  The three major stages of the project included: 


  **Stage 1 -** Construction of a 450 metre rock armour and concrete seawall to
  protect the foreshore from ongoing erosion.


  **Stage 2** - Construction and landscaping works for the creating of Rowan
  Robinson Park - a new central park connecting the Kingscliff CBD to the
  Pacific Ocean. 


  **Stage 3 -** Construction and landscaping works for the upgrade of the
  Kingscliff Beach Holiday Park.
