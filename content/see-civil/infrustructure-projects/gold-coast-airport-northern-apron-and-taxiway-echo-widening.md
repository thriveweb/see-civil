  SEE Civil constructed the northern aircraft apron and widened Taxiway Echo as
  well as facilitating the installation of new refuelling infrastructure at this
  location. The project required complex work staging to ensure works did not
  impact on normal airport operations. SEE Civil was also required to liaise
  heavily between their client (the airport), Caltex as the refuelling
  infrastructrue owner and Caltex's preferred mechanical and electrical
  subcontractor (Lendlease) to facilitate the programming of the works required.
