  The Bangalow Bridge Replacement Project, involved the demolition, salavage and
  replace of five ageing timber bridges in the Byron Shire, near Bangalow in
  northern New South Wales. 


  The bridges were replaced with modular steel lineof communication (Bailey)
  bridges, purcahse by Byron Shire Council from surplus Australian Army Stock.


  The project was a vital infrastructure upgrade as the load restrictions due to
  the condition of the existing timber bridges was restricting transport
  operation and connectivity for the community around each bridge site. 


  SEE Civil, in partnership with SRG Limited, developed an innovative bridge
  lowering falsework in order to incorporate the typically temporary module
  steel bridge structures into the permanent design of the abutments.
