  The Joint User Hydrant Infrastructure (JUHI) project involved the extension of
  existing fuel lines on the domestic aircraft apron of the Gold Coast Airport.
  SEE Civil successfully relocated the jet-fuel main from Bay 10 to Bay 7. This
  project was integral to ensuring the airport could facilitate increased
  international demand prior to, during and immediately following the 2018
  Commowealth Games. 


  SEE Civil particpated in an early contractor involvement process for the
  project assisting the client to develop the scope and undertaking a cost
  benefit analysis prior to commencment due to the complexity of the works and
  the interface required with the machanical and electricla contractor. 


  Throughout construction, SEE Civil developed an excavation and staging
  technique that reduced impacts on the existing apron and provided time and
  cost benefits to the project.

    content: >-
      * Airside  underground service location and demolition of existing service
      features to expose the fuel main near the valve chamber

      * Trenching, shoring and dewatering across the aircraft apron to construct
      new fuel line 

      * Construction of concrete structures including valve chamber pits and
      hydrant biscuit slabs

      * Safe removal and relocation of spoil from a highly sensitive operational
      area

      * Development and implemnetation of Construction Environmental Management
      Plan including specifics around the management of PFAS and acid sulfate
