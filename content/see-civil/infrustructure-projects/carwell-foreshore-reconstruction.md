  The foreshore of the township of Cardwell, in far north Queensland, was
  significantly damaged during Tropical cyclone Yasi in 2011. 


  IN mid 2012, SEE Civil was appointed by the Department of Transport and Main
  Roads and the Cassowary Coast Regional Council to rebuild the foreshore
  including reconstruction of about 1.5 kilometres of the Bruce Highway through
  the township of Cardwell, construction of a 950 metre long seawall to proctect
  the rebuilt highway and foreshore from future damage and the construction of
  soft and hard landscaping along the foreshore including a playground an 4.5
  kilometre shared user pathway. 


  The result of SEE Civil's work in Cardwell is a beautiful and functional
  foreshore precinct which has become a centralised community building point for
  the Cardwell community.
