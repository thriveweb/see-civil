  The Mount Lindesay Highway Safety Improvements project - North Maclean
  involves the construction of a new 1.2 kilometre service road connecting the
  Chambers Flat Road interchange with a new signalised intersection at Greenbank
  Road. 


  The project required careful and considered traffic staging to manage the
  20,000 average vehicle movements per day along the Mount Lindesay Highway. 


  The project offers improved safety outcomes for motorists and the community as
  well as reducing the potential for traffic crashes.
