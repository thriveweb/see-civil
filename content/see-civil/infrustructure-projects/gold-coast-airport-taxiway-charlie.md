  The Taxiway Charlie Link Project involved the construction of about 450 metres
  of new airside pavement linking two existing taxiways at the Gold Coast
  Airport as well as asphalt overlay and strengthening of Taxiways Alpha, Delta
  and Charlie South. 


  These works were conducted in a secure airside environment - including
  significant nightworks and temporary runway and taxiway closures. A cement
  treadt rock base course was required as part of the project.
