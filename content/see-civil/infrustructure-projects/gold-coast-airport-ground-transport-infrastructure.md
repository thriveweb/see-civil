  The Ground Transport Infrastructure (GTI) project undertaken at the Gold Coast
  Airport involved upgrades to existing and construction of new roads, taxi
  ranks, bus parking and car parking areas. A key scope of the works was
  permanently diverting, then backfilling a significant drainage area to
  facilitate future airport upgrades including the construction of a new hotel.


  As Principal Contractor, SEE Civil was responsible for the overall
  environmental, safety and traffic management for the site. 


  SEE Civil has delivered many projects at the Gold Coast Airport, become a
  trusted contractor for the Gold Coast Airport Corporation. This was evidenced
  on the GTI project when SEE Civil assisted with progressive desing development
  of works packages following initial award. The SEE Civil team also developed
  construction methods that addressed acid sulfate soil and PFAS soil issues as
  well as delivering time and cost efficiencies for the project.

      of dedicated treament areas

      * Installation of drainage infrastructure,  including the largest
      Awquceptor Gross Polluntant Trap in the southern hemisphere, in water
      charged ground.

      * Staged installation of sheet piles to create a coffer dam to enable
      filling activities

      * Staged dewatering of Coolangatta Creek to enable filling and new
      stormwater installation

      * Placement of approximately 25,000m3 of onsite spoil (from previous
      airport projects)
