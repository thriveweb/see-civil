  PEET Ltd is developing Flagstone, a satellite city near Jimboomba. Flagstone
  forms part of the [Greater Flagstone Priority Development
  Area](https://www.dsdmip.qld.gov.au/economic-development-qld/priority-development-areas/greater-flagstone.html).
  At completion, Flagstone will have around 12,000 homes and a 126 hectare
  commercial centre.


  SEE Civil's initial scope of works for the development two small residential
  stages of around 60 residential lots each. Since completion of these stages,
  SEE Civil has been awarded ongoing packages at Flagstone including a further
  five residential lot packages and the earthworks and civil works for a future
  school site.


  A key challenge associated with the delivery of works at Flagstone is the
  ground conditions and requirements to excavate through very hard rock
  material. In some stages, SEE Civil has adopting a drill, blast and on-site
  crush methodology to achieve the desired construction program.  


  SEE Civil has been working with clients Peet Pty Ltd to deliver rolling
  packages of work since early 2018.
