  The Logan Link Industrial Estate is a large industrial estate in Berrinba,
  close to the Logan Motorway. Construction of the site included extensive
  earthworks and retaining structures, new signalised intersections built to
  Department of Transport and Main Road specifications and complex service
  works, including a piled bridging structure for water and sewer trunk mains. 


  SEE Civil completed the civil and earthworks for the site in September 2012.
  The site was formed into seven large commercial and industrial blocks, the
  largest of which is now occupied by Toll Logistics.
