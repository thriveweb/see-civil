    content: "Design and construction of RockBlock retaining wall system to suit the developer and TOLL needs\r\n\nThe site earthworks had some challenges with the variable materials ranging from low quality clay to sandstone.\r\n\nThis site also had a low-lying area where an environmental zone was maintained.\r\n\nThe works were under the control of 3 authorities, which added some complications.  They were Brisbane City Council, Logan Council and TMR.  The complications were mainly to do with any interface between the authorities."
