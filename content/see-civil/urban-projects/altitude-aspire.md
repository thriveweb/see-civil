content: "Altitude Aspire is a residential development in Terranora, New South Wales. SEE Civil delivered the earthworks and civil infrastructure for the initial two stages of the development. \n\nSEE Civil’s scope of work included bulk and detailed earthworks, installation of stormwater drainage, water and sewer reticulation (including pump stations), soft and hard landscaping and internal and external roadworks. External Roadworks were completed on Fraser Drive, Terranora.\n\n\rAltitude Aspire was constructed in extremely difficult earth working conditions. The site has up to 50-metre height differences between the front (Fraser Drive) and back of the site. Installing water infrastructure was especially challenging under these conditions. The project site also sloped towards the sensitive Terranora Broadwater requiring careful attention to be paid to the environmental, and particularly water   management on the site. \n\nIn 2018, SEE Civil’s work at Altitude Aspire was a finalist in the Civil Contractors Federation of New South Wales Earth Awards."

  - title: Scope of Works
    content: "* Bulk earthworks of around 240,000m3 using cut-to-fill management. Cuts of up to 6 metres were required but were managed so that material import was required.\r\n* Bulk and detailed earthworks in difficult terrain including Krasnozem soils, grades of up to 18 per cent and a 50 metres height difference between the front (Fraser Drive) of the site and the back).\r\n* Contaminated land remediation and management including areas of asbestos containing materials, residual pesticides and hydrocarbons from agricultural activities and acid sulfate soils.\r\n* Removal of around 40,000m3 of floating rock found within fill material.\r\n* Installation of all stormwater infrastructure.\r\n* Installation of sewer and water reticulation systems, including construction of a pump station at the base of the site.\r\n* All required internal roadworks\r\n* External roadworks (Fraser Drive) completed under live traffic to help increase the capacity of nearby road network.\r\n* Erosion, sediment and stormwater control during the project.\r\n* Installation of complex temporary and permanent drainage systems including a permanent weir and filtration system to ensure no run off from the site (temporary and permanent) entered the Broadwater without filtration.\r\n* Protection of a natural drainage challenge at the base of the site which drained directly into the Terranora Broadwater (SEPP 14 wetlands area)."
