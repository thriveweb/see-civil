  Empire Industrial Estate is a 127 hectare industrial site located within the
  Yatala Enterprise Area in Queensland. SEE has completed eight of a proposed
  ten industrial land stages at Empire. 


  The project has required significant bulk earthworks (in excess of 2 million
  cubic metres) with drill and blast operations and on site crushing
  required.During some stages, earthworks production rates of 5,000 cubic metres
  per day were achieved in order to be meet the desired construction program. 


  Other works have including the construction of two large retaining walls along
  Peachey Road using SEE Civil's innovative Rock Block retaining solution. Rock
  Block has been designed to maximise the land yield for developers by
  maximising the useable land above retaining walls. 


  SEE Civil has also completed civil infrastructure works for the development
  including water and sewer reticulation systems, an external trunk sewer
  upgrade and installation of communications and electrical infrastructure - 
  all designed for commercial and industrial use.
