  The Centra Park Estate industrial development is a key parcel of industrial
  land and one of the first major developments delivered in Yatala. 


  SEE Civil undertook  the bulk andd etailed earthworks for the site as well as
  some civil works. 


  The earth retaining required at the site was the catalyst for SEE Civil to
  develop their innovative Rock Block retaining wall system. Rock Block
  maximises land yields by allowing for hard compaction against the retaining
  walls, making it possible to build pavements and other structures directly
  above walls.
