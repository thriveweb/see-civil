  Salt Village is a residential and commerical development at Casuarina, just
  south of Kingscliff in northern New South Wales. Salt has redefined beachside
  living on the Tweed Coast. The village combines resort style living and
  holiday accomodation plus a retail and community precinct.


  SEE Civil delivered the earthworks and civil works associated with Salt
  Village in a difficult earth working environment. The project required around
  1 million tonnes of sand to be moved across 7.5 kilometres to fill a 700,000
  cubic metre hole. SEE Civil identified that this could be achieved through
  pumping rather than a traditional trucking method to reduce impacts. SEE Civil
  designed and constructed a silenced dredge at their company owned sand quarry
  in order to move the sand without detrimental impacts to nearby neighbours.

    content: >-
      * Bulk and detailed earthworks in challenging ground conditions based
      predominantly in sand

      * Installation of civil infrastrucutre including water, electrical and
      telecommunications 

      * Use of hydro-cyclones to remove pyritic fines and return to the lake bed
      during dredging 

      * Design and construction of a silenced dredge at sand pit to faciltate
      sand removal

      * Purpose built metering plant for addition of both agricultural and
      hydrated lime to constantly correct ph levels 

      * Construction of a custom built mulching machine ensuring dunal scrub was
      cleared and placed immediately on site to eliminate erosion potential

      * The innovative use of the custom-built dredge system saved some 40,000
      truck movements on local roads
