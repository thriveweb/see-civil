  - title: Description of works
    content: "Salt Village has redefined beachside living on the Tweed Coast. SEE Civil delivered the earthworks and civil works associated with Salt Village in a difficult earth working environment.  \r\n\nThe project required around 1 million tonnes of sand to be moved across 7.5 kilometres to fill a 700,000 cubic metre hole. SEE Civil identified that this could be achieved through pumping rather than a traditional trucking method to reduce impacts. SEE Civil designed and constructed at silenced dredge at their sand pit in order to move the sand without detrimental impacts to nearby neighbours."
