  Habitat is a mixed-use development located on Bayshore Drive, north of Byron
  Bay's town centre and adjacent to the Arts and Industrial Estate. The
  development is made up of an innovative mix of live-work housing, commercial
  and community facilities with the aim of becoming a village where residents
  can live, work and play successfully. 


  SEE Civil undertook the bulk earthworks, detailed earthworks and civil
  construction elements of the development. Civil works were completed in 2016,
  with ongoing building works now being undertaken progressively by building
  contractors.
