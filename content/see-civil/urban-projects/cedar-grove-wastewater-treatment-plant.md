  This award-winning project saw SEE Civil deliver several key construction
  works for a new waste water treatment plant at Cedar Grove near Logan in South
  East Queensland.


  The project was built in a highly environmentally sensitive area being in
  close proximity to the Logan River. As part of our works, we are proud to have
  constructed 8 hectares of wetlands which have become a new home for a variety
  of wading birds and fauna.


  The project included 120,000m3 of bulk earthworks to eight wetland cells,
  incorporation of 5,000T of agricultural lime, installation of distribution
  pipework, precast structures and concrete weirs.


  Methodology was developed to manage onsite excavations in order to win and
  separate in to strict material classifications for use in various layers of
  the wetland construction.
