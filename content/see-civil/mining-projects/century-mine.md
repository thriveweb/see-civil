  In 2015 SEE Civil were approached by Century Mine to establish our modular
  trommel to produce three products for environmental works at the mine. The
  machine needed to be able to take up to 1500 size rock and be able to process
  1,000 tonnes per hour.


  The work was completed in October and November of 2015 with the total quantity
  of 150,000 tonnes of rock products being produced. 


  The machinery had been engineered and built by SEE in our Chinderah facility
  and its performance exceeded expectations.
