  On behalf of the Australian and NSW governments, Roads and Maritime Services
  progressively upgraded the Pacific Highway to dual carriageway between the
  Hunter and NSW/Queensland border. The Woolgoolga to Ballina Pacific Highway
  upgrade involved the duplication of 155 kilometres to a four-lane divided
  road. The upgrade starts six kilometres north of Woolgoolga (north of Coffs
  Harbour) and ends six kilometres south of Ballina.


  This Section 5 Foamed Bitumen package involved the provision and placing of
  foamed bitumen pavement on the northbound and southbound carriageway of the
  Pacific Highway between the new Maclean interchange and the Iluka
  Interchange. 


  SEE Civil worked collaboratively with Roads and Maritime Services and Pacific
  Complete to deliver this part of the Woolgoolga to Ballina Pacific Highway
  upgrade.
