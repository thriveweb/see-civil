  SEE Civil started construction in January 2020 on the duplication of the
  existing Mount Lindesay Highway in Jimboomba between Camp Cable Road and the
  Tamborine/Johanna Street intersection. SEE Civil have won three of the four
  projects along the Mount Lindesay Highway since TMR announced funding in late
  2016 for the Mount Lindesay Highway upgrades between Jimboomba and North
  Maclean.


  This project duplicated the existing Mt Lindesay Highway in Jimboomba between
  Camp Cable Road and Johanna Street to create flood immunity by constructing a
  new northbound alignment 3m higher than the existing road alignment. 


  SEE Civil remains passionate and committed to providing local benefit
  opportunities to the project’s region through support of the local communities
  and businesses as previously demonstrated during our delivery of the last two
  packages.
