  Trans4m Rail, a joint venture between contractors John Holland Group and SEE
  Civil, was announced in November 2020 as the Principal Contractor for Inland
  Railâ€™s Narrabri to North Star Separable Portion 1 (N2NS-SP1) in North West New
  South Wales. The N2NS-SP1 section is one of 13 projects that complete Inland
  Rail and is an upgrade of 186km of existing track, construction of 2.3km of
  new rail and the construction of multiple bridges and culvert crossings.  The
  scope also includes the signalisation of sidings and level crossings at key
  points in the alignment.  All works are constructed under track possessions.


  The project team are currently in the launch phase of this project completing
  over 43 management and subplans along with the planning and constructing of
  enabling works (ie. camp setup, laydown areas, training hub, onboarding
  workforce and main construction office setup) and are expected to start on
  site in April 2021. The project is expected to be complete in the fourth
  quarter of 2023.
