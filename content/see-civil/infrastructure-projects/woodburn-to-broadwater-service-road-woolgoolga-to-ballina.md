  On behalf of the Australian and NSW governments, Roads and Maritime Services
  progressively upgraded the Pacific Highway to dual carriageway between the
  Hunter and NSW/Queensland border. The Woolgoolga to Ballina Pacific Highway
  upgrade involved the duplication of 155 kilometres to a four-lane divided
  road. The upgrade starts six kilometres north of Woolgoolga (north of Coffs
  Harbour) and ends six kilometres south of Ballina. 


  The Woodburn to Broadwater service road project is part of the Woolgoolga to
  Ballina Pacific Highway upgrade. SEE Civil worked collaboratively with Roads
  and Maritime Services and Pacific Complete to deliver this part of the
  Woolgoolga to Ballina Pacific Highway upgrade. 


  In moving traffic onto the new service road, work was able to continue on the
  new highway. Separating traffic helped minimise the impact of work and improve
  safety for workers and highway motorists.  The service road remains as a local
  road between Woodburn and Broadwater following the completion of the Pacific
  Highway upgrade.

    content: "* Construction of the main alignment of a 3.5-kilometre new service road between Woodburn and Broadwater in northern New South Wales, adjacent to the existing Pacific Highway and within the Broadwater National Park.\r\n* Design and construction of temporary intersections and site accesses\r\n* All approved clearing and grubbing for the site\r\n* All earthworks for the road alignment\r\n* Installation of drainage infrastructure\r\n* All road surface, primer, seal, road barriers, fencing, road furniture and other ancillary works required for the road construction.\r\n* Construction of a bridge over a fauna passage on the service road including installation of tubular piles. Bridge construction included:\r\n  * Construction of bridge foundations consisting of 900Dia and 1050Dia steel driven piles, which were concrete infilled. For the central pier, 1050Dia piles were extended to 900Dia cast-in-situ columns.\r\n  * Construction of a two-span bridge over a fauna passage with each span consisting of six pre-stressed concrete planks.\r\n  * Installation of all earthwork for pre-cast abutments on both sides of the bridge.\r\n  * Pre-stressed, pre-cast concrete deck planks were tied together with a 180mm thick cast-in-situ deck."
