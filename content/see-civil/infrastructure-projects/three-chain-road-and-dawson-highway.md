  The Three Chain Road and Dawson Highway project saw the construction of a new
  local road and highway upgrade adjacent to and through the Dawson Mine for
  Anglo American, near Moura in Central Queensland.


  The Three Chain Road works were located within the operating mine lease
  (Dawson Mine leases ML 5591 and ML 5598) and private land. The area of works
  was excised from mine operations and works were carried out under the Work
  Health and Safety Act 2011 and Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011. 


  The Dawson Highway works duplicated the existing highway while extending the
  Three Chain Road bell mouth to facilitate larger haul trucks due to the
  location against the Aurizon rail line.
