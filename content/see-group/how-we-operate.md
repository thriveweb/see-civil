      ### Safety


      We place our people at the centre of our risk management process. We talk
      with them, listen to them and ask them what they need to do the job
      safely. Once agreed, we act on their advice. 


      Our safety processes are award-winning, having taken home awards at the
      SafeWork NSW and Safe Work and Return to Work Awards (QLD) in 2018 and
      more recently the 2020 SafeWork NSW Award for our 'Outstanding work health
      and safety response to the changed working environment due to COVID-19'.


      SEE Group businesses operate under a third-party accredited safety
      management system.


      #### We've built our safety resilience and an excellent safety culture by:


      * Encouraging our workforce through effective consultation, collaboration
      and communication and encouraging employee-driven solutions to safety
      issues and concerns. 

      * Understanding the reasons for success as well as learning from our
      mistakes. 

      * Recognising that managing safety is an ethical responsibility, not a
      bureaucratic activity and that we're all responsible for working safely.

      ### Environmental excellence


      As an experienced group of companies, SEE Group recognises that our works
      have the potential to impact on the environment. We’re committed to
      minimising and reducing the environmental impacts of our operations.


      We encourage environmental awareness within our workforce and support
      project teams to uphold the highest standards when implementing our
      environmental procedures. The environmental procedures and policies
      contained within our integrated management system comply with the relevant
      environmental legislation and regulations. 


      SEE Civil in particular, has vast experience working successfully on
      environmentally sensitive projects including works within Endangered
      Ecological Communities. We’ve received praise from clients and government
      agencies alike for our commitment to environmental standards and won the
      2017 CCF Earth Awards for our unrivalled environmental management
      initiatives.


      SEE Group is committed to positive environmental outcomes of any projects
      it undertakes.

      ### Social & Community


      At its core, SEE Group is family company with strong community values. As
      such, we acknowledge the role we must play in supporting the communities
      we operate in. 


      We’re committed to advancing social outcomes for communities nearby to our
      projects and dedicated to providing employment and training opportunities
      for locals. 


      On previous projects, we’ve regularly exceeded our Aboriginal
      Participation in Construction (APiC) objectives and provided opportunities
      for trainees, apprentices and graduates to enter the workforce. 


      SEE Group provides financial and value in-kind sponsorship to a range of
      community-based organisations and sporting clubs as well as regularly
      undertaking charitable giving. Our project teams continually look for ways
      they can support the communities they are working in and often provide
      in-kind skilled labour, construction work or human resources to support
      community projects nearby.
